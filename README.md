# matplotlib_csv
Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

In the course of this project we learned how to read information from a CVS file and plot it on graphs using the matplotlib class.
We created 5 total files to showcase different examples of how we could use the matplotlib class. The first three files used the information from Sitka and the remaining 2 used information from Death Valley. At the end we were able to graph the information from Sitka and Death Valley in a side to side comparision in order to compare them.
